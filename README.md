![Minimal SIR model](./epidemic.png)

Do you know how an epidemic grows? One infects two, two infect four or three or two or one or none. All with different probabilities and a weighted average of logistic growth.

The Minimal SIR model is a discrete stochastic compartmental model of an epidemic that averages to the (ordinary differential equation) standard SIR model (Kermack-McKendrick, 1927).
Each individual within a population is in one of three states known, in epidemic modelling, as compartments: 

* S - Susceptible to infection.
* I - Infected and infectious.
* R - Recovered and immune to re-infection.
