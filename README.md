The Minimal SIR model is a compartmental model of an epidemic that averages to the standard SIR model (Kermack-McKendrick, 1927).
Each individual within a population is in one of three states known, in epidemic modelling, as compartments: 

* S - Susceptible to infection.
* I - Infected and infectious.
* R - Recovered and immune to re-infection.
